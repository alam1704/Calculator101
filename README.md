### Description

Write a calculator application service that can receive XML and/or JSON via HTTP POST and perform mathematical operations and send the answer back over HTTP\XML.

### Requirements  

- Use the programming language that they prefer, but preferably C# .net framework
- The calculator should show use cases of serialisation, inheritance, encapsulation, and interface design
- The design should allow for different XML inputs with minimal to no C# code changes
- TDD - test driven development should be used prove that the calculator works.

### Additional considerations

1. Implementation of interfaces to showcase the different Math’s operations

2. Implementation of inheritances to showcase the different Math’s operations

3. Implementation of recursions to showcase calculation of complex operations

  a. E.g. 2 + 3 + (4 x 5) è 2 + 3 + 20 è 25

4. Implementation of exception handlings

5. Showcasing test cases

6. Showcasing XML / JSON string handling. From XML / JSON to classes

7. Showcasing ability to cater for different XML / JSON inputs

8. Showcasing ability to cater for different XML / JSON structure with minimal to no code changes

9. Showcasing HTTP usage

10. Showcasing an unit test framework
